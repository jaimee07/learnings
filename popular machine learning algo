CAregories of Supervised learning
1. binary classification  - use statistical computation to determine if yes or no after training a model using labeled data 
- is this a hotdog?
2. multiclass classification
- classfly into different snack categories
3. regression
- how many snack needed for the upcoming christmas event?
- how many rooms will be booked on christmas season?

Decision Trees
- algo creates a decision tree based on the chosen predictors to identify/produce outcome
- if you reach entropy, that is, the decision tree does not tell anything about the outcome, then you might need new or additional predictors
k-nearest neighbor
- lazy learning - because learning doesnt happen continuously, run computation in one big instance
- compares something you dont know to what you already have
- algo looks at the nearest neighbors to classify the unknown data
k-means clustering
- unsupervised clustering
- the algo tries to find the best combination of clusters to group the data

regression analysis
- more on predicting(statistical model) than learning

Conditional probabilty
- bayes theorem
